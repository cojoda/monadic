# Monadic Self-Improving Code Generator

## Long Term
- Evolve into a fully autonomous agent that can manage its own features, testing, and releases.
- Develop a sophisticated understanding of its own architecture to perform complex refactors.
- Optimize for cost, performance, and code quality based on high-level human guidance.

## Short Term
- Refactor the agent's architecture to use a "Task Abstraction" pattern. Create an `LLMTask` abstract base class responsible for bundling a system prompt with its corresponding Pydantic response model. Convert the existing logic for code generation and integration into specific subclasses of `LLMTask` to make the system more robust and extensible. **This entire task must be completed without editing any of the files listed in `protected.yaml`.**
