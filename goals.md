# Monadic Self-Improving Code Generator

## Long Term
- Evolve into a fully autonomous agent that can manage its own features, testing, and releases.
- Develop a sophisticated understanding of its own architecture to perform complex refactors.
- Optimize for cost, performance, and code quality based on high-level human guidance.

## Short Term
- Create the initial testing infrastructure.

This involves the following steps:
1.  Create a `tests` directory for all test files.
2.  Add a `pytest.ini` file to configure `pytest`.
3.  Create a simple placeholder test in `tests/test_placeholder.py` that always passes to ensure the test runner is working correctly.
4.  Modify `improver/orchestrator.py`: After the integration step is complete, run `pytest` to execute the tests. For now, the results should just be printed, and a failing test should not block the application of the changes.
