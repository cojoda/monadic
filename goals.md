# Monadic Self-Improving Code Generator

## Long Term
- Evolve into a fully autonomous agent that can manage its own features, testing, and releases.
- Develop a sophisticated understanding of its own architecture to perform complex refactors.
- Optimize for cost, performance, and code quality based on high-level human guidance.

## Short Term
- The LLMTask abstract base class, located in the file improver/core.py, needs refactoring. The objective is to make the class implementation more concise and to simplify its logic where possible. The refactored code must maintain all original functionality but achieve it with fewer lines of code.
