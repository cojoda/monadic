# Monadic Self-Improving Code Generator

## Long Term
- Evolve into a fully autonomous agent that can manage its own features, testing, and releases.
- Develop a sophisticated understanding of its own architecture to perform complex refactors.
- Optimize for cost, performance, and code quality based on high-level human guidance.

## Short Term
- In improver/models.py, expand the WorkflowContext to include a new field: branch_proposals (List[Dict]). In improver/orchestrator.py, after the BranchRunners complete, store their results in this new field.
