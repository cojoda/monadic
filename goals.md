# Monadic Self-Improving Code Generator

## Long Term
- Evolve into a fully autonomous agent that can manage its own features, testing, and releases.
- Develop a sophisticated understanding of its own architecture to perform complex refactors.
- Optimize for cost, performance, and code quality based on high-level human guidance.

## Short Term
- Refactor the 'Integration Phase' within the `run` method of `improver.py`. The objective is to make the code more concise and simplify the conditional logic that handles the cases for zero, one, or multiple successful branches. The refactored code must maintain all original functionality but achieve it with fewer lines of code.
