# Monadic Self-Improving Code Generator

## Long Term
- Evolve into a fully autonomous agent that can manage its own features, testing, and releases.
- Develop a sophisticated understanding of its own architecture to perform complex refactors.
- Optimize for cost, performance, and code quality based on high-level human guidance.

## Short Term
- Refactor `improver.py`. The objective is to make the code more concise and simplify logic. The refactored code must maintain all original functionality but achieve it with fewer lines of code. **This entire task must be completed without editing any of the files listed in `protected.yaml`.**
