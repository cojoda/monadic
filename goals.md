# Monadic Self-Improving Code Generator

## Long Term
- Evolve into a fully autonomous agent that can manage its own features, testing, and releases.
- Develop a sophisticated understanding of its own architecture to perform complex refactors.
- Optimize for cost, performance, and code quality based on high-level human guidance.

## Short Term
- Implement a self-correction mechanism. When a syntax check fails on a given iteration, the agent should not discard the attempt. Instead, it must automatically start a new iteration, feeding the `SyntaxError` message back into the prompt and asking the LLM to fix its own mistake.
