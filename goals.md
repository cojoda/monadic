# Monadic Self-Improving Code Generator

## Long Term
- Evolve into a fully autonomous agent that can manage its own features, testing, and releases.
- Develop a sophisticated understanding of its own architecture to perform complex refactors.
- Optimize for cost, performance, and code quality based on high-level human guidance.

## Short Term
- Implement the deadlock prevention mechanism.

This will be achieved by:
1.  Creating a simple JSON-based logger, `test_failure_log.json`, to keep track of which tests have failed and how many times in a row.
2.  In `improver/orchestrator.py`, before running a new improvement, check this log. If a test has failed on the previous two attempts for the same goal, halt the process and print a message advising a human to review the failing test.
3.  If a test run succeeds, the log for that test should be cleared.
