# Monadic Self-Improving Code Generator

## Long Term
- Evolve into a fully autonomous agent that can manage its own features, testing, and releases.
- Develop a sophisticated understanding of its own architecture to perform complex refactors.
- Optimize for cost, performance, and code quality based on high-level human guidance.

## Short Term
- Implement a two-stage syntax validation using `ast.parse()`. **Stage 1:** After each individual iteration within a branch, validate the generated code to fail early. **Stage 2:** Validate the final, integrated code before it is written to disk. A `SyntaxError` at either stage should cause that specific attempt to be discarded.
